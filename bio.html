            <p> I was born in alaska and moved here when I was 7. I grew up playing all different sports. I ran cross country in high school and was addicted to it. I worked in an oil field after graduation for 6 years. After that I started and owned a landscape business before selling to my partner. I then got into traveling and cooking, both of which I love. </p>
